Key Highlights:

Packet Capture: The tool listens for IPv4 packets on the network, capturing them in real-time.

Data Extraction: It extracts crucial information from each packet, including source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, and the payload data when available.

Real-Time Analysis: Provides instantaneous analysis of network traffic, which is essential for understanding network behavior and diagnosing issues.

Explanation:

Packet Sniffing:
The tool monitors network traffic to capture IPv4 packets. This is essential for analyzing the data being transmitted over the network.

Data Extraction:
From each captured packet, the tool extracts the source and destination IP addresses. These addresses indicate where the packet is coming from and where it is going.
It also identifies the protocol being used, which helps in understanding the type of communication occurring (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
If the packet contains a payload (actual data being sent), the tool extracts and displays this as well.

Ethical Considerations:
Emphasizing the ethical use of this tool is crucial. Packet sniffers can be powerful tools for network analysis and troubleshooting, but they can also be misused if not handled responsibly. This project was undertaken with a strong emphasis on ethical practices, ensuring that it serves educational and network diagnostic purposes only.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to delve into network protocols and the practical application of cybersecurity concepts. I'm excited to continue learning and contributing to the field of network security.
